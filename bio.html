        <p class="para para-body">I did my graduation from University of Calcutta, India. Worked in my family business for last
          seven years in various positions and through my journey I learnt the complex and agile paths of
          business world. In this seven years journey I also started my own construction business we built
          commercial buildings, construction in India is really a challenge because you need to deal with
          
          severe political challenges, and but I overcome every challenges and completed the project
          with success. That increased my self confidence and passion for success.</p>
        <p class="para para-body">Then on 2015 I moved
          to Canada for higher studies. I did my post graduation in finance from Thompson Rivers
          University, where I discovered my new passion for stock market. While studying I started doing
          day trading and my biggest trade is marijuana stocks where I made a lot of money. My plan
          from business school days was to do something innovative in finance which will help non-
          finance people to use financial tools better. Then after completion I started this fintech
          company DhanRhak Investments Inc.</p>

        <p class="para para-body">I belong to a business family; there is no one in my family who has done job till now. My father
          is a small business owner in a small city and I learnt basics of the business from him while
          helping him in his trade. With the same thought of learning business, I decided to do my high
          school in commerce as I had great passion to learn the business from my early childhood. In
          High School, I learnt the basics of accounting, management, economics and mathematics.
          Because of my decent results in high school, I got admission in Panjab University and there I
          completed my Bachelor of Commerce (Honours). After graduation, I planned to move to
          Canada for pursuing higher education in Finance. I came to Canada in 2016 and completed my
          Post Baccalaureate Diploma in Finance from Thompson Rivers University in 2018. During this
          time, I met Raj Mukherjee, our company director and he was my peer and mentor as well.
          Together, we decided to make our own corporation which we named DhanRhak Investments
          Inc., the sole aim of this organization is to help small businesses and general public, by making
          them finance available in case of need.</p>
        <p class="para para-body">Presently, I am working as Financial Services Rep in a large corporation and learning the various
          skills and techniques of industry, which will help me to operate the business successfully. We
          are a team of highly dedicated individuals that is working hand on hand to make our passion
          realty.</p>
